It uses React, Redux, Next.JS and Ant Design.

Circle CI does the CD to Github Pages. Check it out! https://gztomas.github.io/messenger

## Install

You will need Yarn. If you are using macOS and have home-brew installed, then you can get it by doing

```sh
brew install yarn
```

Otherwise, please follow yarn team [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

When Yarn is installed then you can install the app dependencies with

```sh
cd <repo_dir>
yarn
```

You can then start a development server with the following command

```sh
yarn dev
```

Then just opens your browser at http://localhost:3000
